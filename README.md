# food360

This repo is for the final project of the course, Applied Fundamentals of Machine Learning.   
Our project’s goal is to train a model that can classify a food image, such as miso soup and pizza. Also created a simple web app, written using Flutter, for easier testing. I’m responsible for the primary model tunning, training, and web app.  

For details on the project, you can refer to my [personal web page](https://compsci.dev/portfolio-archive/applied-fundamentals-of-machine-learning/).  
PS: AI is not my area of expertise.
